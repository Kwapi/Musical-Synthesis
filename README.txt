In order to use the program you first have to set the working directory in Matlab to the extracted folder path.

Once "Current Folder" tab in MatLab shows all the necessary files (functions, main function, samples and tracks) open MusicalSynthesis.m and run it.


Additional notes:

Track1/2/3 contain traditional musical notation transcribed into the midi form that can be read by the program.
The first number represents the note in the MIDI scale (69 - A4, etc) ':' acts as a delimeter and the next number represents the duration of the note (1 - crotchet - one beat etc.)
